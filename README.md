# Production-Analysis-Notes
## 1. Introduction to Economics 
Economics is the study of how scarce resources 
are allocated to satisfy unlimited wants. It 
examines production, distribution, and 
consumption of resources in society. 
Professor Robbins defines economics as a science 
'which studies human behavior as a relationship 
between ends and scarce means which have 
alternative uses.' 



## 2. Nature and Scope of Economics - Economics as a Science: Systematic study of 
cause-and-effect relationships. - Economics as an Art: Practical application of 
economic knowledge. 
- Positive Economics: Describes 'what is.' - Normative Economics: Explains 'what ought to 
be.' 



## 3. Principles of Business Economics 
Important principles aiding rational decision
making include: - Marginal Principle: Focus on changes in cost and 
revenue per unit. - Incremental Principle: Analyzing impact of policy 
changes on cost and revenue. - Equi-marginal Principle: Allocating resources to 
equalize marginal returns. - Opportunity Cost Principle: Cost of foregone 
alternatives. - Time Perspective Principle: Balancing short-term 
and long-term goals. - Discounting Principle: Future value adjusted for 
present value. 




## 4. Demand 
Definition: Effective demand is a desire backed by 
willingness and ability to pay. 
Determinants of Demand: - Price of the commodity - Income of consumers - Prices of substitutes and complementary goods - Consumer tastes and preferences - Expectations about future prices - Special influences like climate or demographics 
Law of Demand: Ceteris paribus, demand is 
inversely proportional to price. 




## 5. Supply 
Definition: Quantity of a product available for sale 
at a given price and time. 
Determinants of Supply: - Price of the product - Prices of other goods - Future price expectations - Technology advancements - Factor prices and government policies 
Law of Supply: Higher prices lead to greater 
quantity supplied, ceteris paribus. 



6. Market Equilibrium 
Market equilibrium occurs when demand equals 
supply, determining the equilibrium price and 
quantity. 
This state ensures there is no tendency for price to 
change further.
